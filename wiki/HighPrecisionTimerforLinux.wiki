= PIT (Programmable Interval Timer) =

  * using an 8254 CMOS chip ath the 0x40-0x43 port
  * clock signal frequency is about 1000.15 Hz
  * default tick is roughly 10 milliseconds by setting the HZ 100. We can change it to 1000 in linux/include/asm-x86/param.h. So we can get a 1 milliseconds tick.

#define HZ 100

= HPET =

  * frequency must be at leat 10MHz; therefore, the tick is at least 100 nanoseconds.

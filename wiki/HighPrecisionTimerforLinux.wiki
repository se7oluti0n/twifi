= PIT (Programmable Interval Timer) =

  * using an 8254 CMOS chip ath the 0x40-0x43 port
  * clock signal frequency is about 1000.15 Hz
  * default tick is roughly 10 milliseconds by setting the HZ 100. We can change it to 1000 in linux/include/asm-x86/param.h. So we can get a 1 milliseconds tick.

#define HZ 100 
==>
#define HZ 1000


= HPET (High Precision Event Timer) =

  * frequency must be at least 10MHz; therefore, the tick is at least 100 nanoseconds. 

= Timer Interrupt Handler =

  * timer_interrupt() located on arch\x86\kernel\time_32.c or time_64.c
  * do_timer_interrupt_hook() located on include/asm-i386/mach-default/do_timer.h
  * struct clock_event_device \*global_clock_event located on  linux/arch/i386/kernel/i8253.c
